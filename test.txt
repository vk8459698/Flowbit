Department: IT Operations
Author: System Administrator

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report outlines the findings from our recent network infrastructure maintenance conducted on May 27-28, 2025. The maintenance was critical due to increasing latency issues and several security vulnerability patches that needed to be applied.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Server response times improved by 35% after optimization
2. Three critical security patches successfully applied
3. Network bandwidth utilization reduced from 85% to 62%
4. Two legacy switches identified for replacement
5. Firewall rules updated to block 247 new threat signatures

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Switch SW-Floor3-A showing intermittent connectivity problems
- Database server DB-PROD-01 requires memory upgrade (current: 32GB, recommended: 64GB)
- Backup system failed twice during maintenance window
- Wireless access points in Building C need firmware updates

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace SW-Floor3-A within 30 days to prevent network outages
2. Schedule DB-PROD-01 memory upgrade for next maintenance window
3. Investigate backup system failures and implement redundancy
4. Deploy new wireless firmware to Building C access points immediately

CONCLUSION:
The maintenance was successful overall, resulting in significant performance improvements. However, the identified issues require prompt attention to maintain system reliability and security posture.

Next scheduled maintenance: June 15, 2025
Estimated downtime: 4 hours
Priority level: Medium
